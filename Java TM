Working through this file I found that I am lacking in java knowledge. I am taking CSC130 and CSC60 concurrently 
with this course, so I do not know a lot about linked lists, trees, and commands from command prompt. I seem to
have struggled the most with putting together the summary task, task duration, and summary. I searched the 
internet for code on how to properly read and write a file. In CSC15 we learned how to use scanners to read and 
write a text file. For this project I used the bufferedreader and bufferedwriter in hopes that it would be easier
to read and write files. I'm not entirely sure how it works but it was said that it was efficient to use according
to this article 
(https://medium.com/@isaacjumba/why-use-bufferedreader-and-bufferedwriter-classses-in-java-39074ee1a966)
In CSC20 we used linked lists for one of our projects that involved stacks and queues. I knew they are similar
to arrays but you can add to them and have infinite space. For this project I used it to store the log text in 
string format one line at a time in the linked list. This was to search each line for the task name and to print 
out the string that was containing it. This method isn't case sensitive so if there is an overlap in words, the
wrong task could appear when printing out the task summary.

For calculating the duration of each task, I didn't know how to get the start time after the first execution of the 
program. I'm not sure where to store the information. My summary without a task doesn't work because I can't figure
out how to stop the args[] string from going out of bounds. So when trying to type in 'summarize' to get the log text
it gets an out of bounds error. I didn't use multiple classes for this project because Iwasn't sure how to use them for 
this. This program is very limited, I didn't try to anything too fancy, I stuck with the basics.
