# Resume
for CSC131
My name is Jessica Garcia, I am new the whole coding world. I started with CSC15 during summer session 2017 at Sacramento State.
In fall 2017 I finished CSC20, CSC28, and CSC35. Before 2017 I never coded anything in my life. I enjoy playing video games in my free time.
I hope to learn more and become be able to create interesting and fun programs as well as program my own game.
