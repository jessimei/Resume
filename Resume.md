# Resume
for CSC131
My name is Jessica Garcia, my GitHub username is Jessimei. I am new to coding, I started with CSC15 during summer session 2017 at Sacramento State.
In fall 2017, I finished CSC20, CSC28, and CSC35. Before 2017 I have never coded anything in my life. I currently work as a student assistant at Water Resources as a member of the National Flood Insurance Program.
Besides computer science classes and work, I enjoy playing video games.
I hope to learn more and be able to create interesting and fun programs as well as program my own game.
